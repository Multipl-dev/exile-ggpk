# Session Handoff: 2026-02-18 — Session 1 (First Independent Handoff)

## Summary
- **Work:** Full ASID bootstrap — scaffolded from scratch; no code changes to library
- **Commits:** 1 (bootstrap scaffolding)
- **Context:** Shared session with exile-vision S3 — workspace methodology overhaul

---

## Completed

### ASID Bootstrap
- `.asid/context/active-context.md` — library state, open API questions, next priorities
- `.asid/context/memory.log` — fork notes, build notes (ooz submodule, C++17), format notes
  (classic GGPK vs bundle, dual hash algorithms)
- `.asid/context/decisions.log` — binary→library crate conversion, ooz submodule strategy
- `.asid/rules/arch.md` — library contract, safety boundaries, memory strategy, versioning
- `.asid/rules/security.md` — FFI safety, file system rules, dependency policy
- `.asid/rules/testing.md` — coverage requirements, FFI testing, CI gate (test + clippy + audit)
- `WEIR/pin.md` — standing rules with Rust/FFI/ooz-specific additions
- `WEIR/ERR` + `WEIR/LESSONS.md` — template-parity with burn-app WEIR
- `CLAUDE.md` — project hub with library structure map, commands, @imports

## Library State (Unchanged from S2)

| Module | Lines | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ggpk/ | ~450 | Classic GGPK format — functional |
| bundles/ | ~460 | Bundle + Oodle decompression — functional |
| dat/ | ~600 | .dat/.dat64 parsing — functional |
| ooz/ | ~85 | FFI wrapper for C++ Oodle — functional |

No functional changes this session — library is at fork baseline.

---

## Open Questions

- **API surface:** What does exile-vision actually need? Audit required before publishing.
- **Streaming vs in-memory:** Access pattern TBD pending exile-vision integration design.
- **PoE patch versioning:** How to signal format compatibility (pre/post 3.11.2, 3.21.2)?

---

## Next Priority

1. Await exile-filter crate location decision (exile-vision #2 dependency)
2. API surface audit — map what exile-vision needs from this library
3. Integration tests — test against real PoE data files

---

## Repo State

```
exile-ggpk: main @ [see git log] pushed
```

---

## Context Budget

- Estimated utilization: ~45% (shared with exile-vision S3)
- Large files read: exile-ggpk src/ module listing (via Explore agent), BOOTSTRAP.md
- Recommendation: session complete — clean stopping point

---

## Notes

- Prior session context (S2) lives in exile-vision/.asid/context/handoff-2026-02-03-s2.md
  (S1-S2 were shared sessions without independent exile-ggpk handoff files)
- ooz submodule: `git submodule update --init` required on fresh clone
- bindgen generates FFI bindings at build time — not checked into git
- GPL-3.0: all new dependencies must be license-audited before adding
