================================================================================

**ggpk-explorer Fork Notes:**
- Original had ~5900 lines total; ~4400 were UI/binary — stripped cleanly
- Four modules are well-isolated: minimal cross-module coupling, safe to develop independently
- ooz submodule (C++ Oodle decompression) is mandatory for modern PoE bundle reading
- GPL-3.0 applies to the fork — all consumers (exile-vision) must also be GPL-3.0

**Build Notes:**
- ooz requires C++17 compiler and cc crate for FFI compilation
- `git submodule update --init` required on fresh clone
- Windows: winres dependency for Windows resource file embedding
- bindgen generates Rust FFI bindings from ooz C headers at build time

**Format Notes:**
- Classic GGPK: pre-3.11.2 PoE — direct file tree in .ggpk
- Bundle format: 3.11.2+ — files packed into compressed bundles
- Hash algorithm changed in 3.21.2: FNV1a (legacy) → MurmurHash64A (modern)
- Both hash algorithms must be supported for full file resolution
