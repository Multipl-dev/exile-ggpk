- Converted ggpk-explorer from binary crate to library crate
  → Rationale: exile-vision needs a programmatic API, not a CLI tool
  → Commit: f0f369d (refactor: convert to library crate)

- Retained all four modules (ggpk, bundles, dat, ooz) during refactor
  → Rationale: all modules are required for full PoE data access
  → dat/ needed for schema-driven game data queries (future use)

- ooz submodule strategy: keep as git submodule (not vendored)
  → Rationale: upstream ooz receives PoE-compatibility updates; submodule stays current
